"""Check the packager's output before an upload (stdlib only).

Runs after the BigWigs packager in the CI package job and before a tag in the release workflow, so what ships is
checked rather than assumed: every file the TOC loads is present, nothing from development is, the licence and README
are there, and the TOC's version and interface were actually substituted by the packager.
