# Coordinator ledger
## wowaddon (done)
- #6 -> PR #7 READY (comments only; upstream dependabot fix v0.400.0). Not merged.
- #4 -> closed completed; moved items -> SPF #161 (new bug, in-game A/B), SPF #162 (new, owner decision), AGF #161.
- Decisions closed as status quo inside #4: wow-xuu.32 Attune wrapper not planned (ARR); wow-xuu.33 Legacy quick menu toggles kept.
- Release process: none (private, v1.0.0 Unreleased, no workflow). No release.
- Post-merge check: Insights > Dependency graph > Dependabot bun job succeeds.
## SkillUp (agent 1 done; agent 2 on #121 + ports)
- #124 -> PR #125 READY (/su trainers); issue left open (trainer visits in game).
- #123 -> left open, needs in-game check (client SkillLineAbility unchanged vs Classic; classic-db 125 only source).
- #122 -> left open, needs WFA-28 waiver (classic-db gameobject_template lock + client Lock DB2) + skinning rule decision.
- Owner decisions: #122 waiver, #122 skinning before confirmation, #124 override file waiver.
- In-game (#125): /su trainers lines; visit BS/LW/Tailoring trainer -> confirmed count rises; trainer window chance/cost and route training still fine.
- Changelog (#125, already in [Unreleased]): **Check the trainer requirements SkillUp guesses with /su trainers.**
## Owner decisions 2026-10-15 ("permission to merge and do all and cut releases when happy") -> took my recommendations
- Merges: coordinator merges green+reviewed PRs. Releases: cut when happy (no pre-tag stop required now; still report).
- SkillUp #122 waiver agreed; skinning '?' until confirmed; #124 no override file (generator exceptions).
- SPF #162: build tooltip time line (a).
- wowaddon: #4 status-quo closes stand; no lockfileVersion CI check.

- SPF #164 (9c2d86b) Subscribe, part of AGF#159. API version stays 1, minor=1 (additive).

- 2026-10-16 OWNER CORRECTION: SPF #143 — Fitz/Polestar may take SPF's code directly (owner clarified on GitHub). Our 'API only, no copying' comment was wrong. Don't comment on it again.
- OWNER CHECKLIST (round 3): add to cjber/.github/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md: "- [ ] A reporter or requester is credited in the changelog bullet and THIRD_PARTY.md (WFA-33)" (session has no push to cjber/.github). Strip <!-- forever-family --> marker lines when pasting store copy. Wago comments not readable: owner skims for names. CurseForge Relations + Wago deps (SPF optional). GitHub topics + pinned repos. Discord invite if wanted. Optional: purge QuestieDB corpus from AGF git history (force-push).

- 2026-10-17 OWNER APPROVED design-agf-spf-split.md (round 7 after round 6 + bug sweep). CF comments: old fetch read page 1 only (API pages via page=N, ignores pageIndex) -> SPF 09-30..10-08 comments missed. New watch/cfwatch.py (all pages+replies, seen.json). Audit agent launched. Scheduled task trig_01SxgDS5iHDEnSH5rtTwtWTx every 3h. overspark posted on Tweaks page (Tweaks already has dungeonEntrances setting).
- 2026-10-17 Owner: my 3-hourly comment task DELETED (Nebula job does it, prompt /home/user/nebula-comment-watch.md). How to read CF comments: GET https://www.curseforge.com/api/v1/mods/<id>/comments?page=N&pageSize=20 (page from 0; pageIndex ignored; max 20; replies nested; credit displayName). IDs SPF 1708599 AGF 1711538 SU 1705762 LF 1708506 TW 1705879. Script watch/cfwatch.py. Still run it before every release.
- 2026-10-17 ~16:00 2nd restart. PARALLEL SESSION (branches fix/*, feat/*, release/*) merged+released: SkillUp #164-167 v0.16.0; Legacy #140 entrance switch v0.10.0; SPF #215 Questie tracker + v1.19.2 (#216). Open: AGF #209, Legacy #143, SkillUp #169 (tracker, -signed). Our bug agents for SkillUp/Legacy/tracker NOT resumed (redundant). Tracker background (AGF #203, Naburiel) still unbuilt -> ask owner.
- Owner: the parallel session is THEIRS. Focus on ours; WATCH theirs (posture: watching; report to owner, never comment on their PRs). Subscribed AGF #209, Legacy #143, SkillUp #169. Tracker background #203 left to them. Watch for new PRs from their branches (fix/ feat/ release/) on each check.
- SPF #217 (S3 Polestar/TomTom compat) merged 42bf0f9. Decision (mine): SPF takes TomTom global from Polestar's shim only when SPF's own 'Let guides set TomTom waypoints' is on; gives it back when off — OK.
- SkillUp #170 credits (SilentGentlemanSG; name casing) merged b4ca8af. forever_sim acceptance: red on SU v0.15.0 with exact syrberus error, green on main.
- SPF #218 (S2 gamepad-safe map, part of #158) merged 8cf8313. Decision: gamepad A-click on SPF pins dropped (tooltips follow cursor) — accepted. H told to port Tweaks DungeonEntrances to ForeverMapMarkers.
- AGF #211 (A3 party quests) merged 1b08abf.
- SPF #219 (S1a+c level/faction hazards) merged 8d7f2f0. Decisions: waiver OK; displayed times must be REAL (hazard only for choice) + exempt short transport connector walks -> follow-up PR by A. S1b (route styles, needs owner local bake + road textures) and S1d (caves by subzone, needs wago terrain source) DEFERRED, owner later. A does SPF 1.20.0 prep after follow-up.
